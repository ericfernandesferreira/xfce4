# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

libwlembed: libwlembed is a Wayland compositor library that allows you to embed
libwlembed: surfaces from one application into another by way of what's called an
libwlembed: "embedded compositor".
libwlembed:
libwlembed: This project consists of two libraries:
libwlembed: - libwlembed, a toolkit-agnostic library that implements the embedded
libwlembed: compositor
libwlembed: - libwlembed-gtk3, a GTK3 library that wraps the embedded compositor
libwlembed: into an easy-to-use GtkWidget called WleGtkSocket
